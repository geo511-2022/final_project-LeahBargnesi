# Introduction

## Background
Food Insecurity is a serious issue that affects 10.5% of America as of 2019, according to Silva (2020). Additionally, due to systemic racism, Black and Hispanic Americans are twice as likely to face food insecurity compared to their white counterparts (Silva, 2020). Particularly, for Erie County, Feeding America (2020) states that 12% of residents are food insecure (110,390 individuals). Community efforts to support Buffalo and Erie County residents have taken the form of urban agriculture and community fridges. Besides providing food provisioning, studies have also shown that these efforts have many other social perks such as recreational benefits and a decrease in crime (Hess and Winner, 2007). The goal of this website is to show how these community efforts have improved food security over time. Demographic data will also be looked at. However, there are some limitations to this. There wasn't information on when each garden was founded, so some have no start dates. The other limitation is these maps right now can only show how food security may have improved and not the other benefits that were previously mentioned. Also, the COVID-19 pandemic did generally worsen food insecurity. Nevertheless, the idea is to show the importance of these community efforts.

## Problem / Question

How has access to community gardens and fridges improved food security in Buffalo, NY and surrounding areas?

# Materials and Methods

The goal of this website is to  make a map that highlights food security from 2009 to 2020 with points on the map where each garden and fridge is, and what year they were put in place. The data sets will be filtered out for Buffalo, NY and surrounding areas. The leaflet package will be utilized to make interactive maps. Data for food insecurity was requested and gathered from Feeding America, and locations of community gardens were requested and gathered from the University at Buffalo's Food Lab. Demographic data will also eventually be used and the package tidy census may be helpful for this.

## Plot of Food insecurity over time
Currently working on merging the data frames so that I can have all years of food security on one map.
```{r}
#ggplot(final_join, aes(Year, Food_Insecurity))+
  #geom_point()


```



## Food Insecurity and Food Provisioning Over Time
Will have an interactive map with food insecurity and community efforts on same map.

# Conclusions

[~200 words]

Clear summary adequately describing the results and putting them in context. Discussion of further questions and ways to continue investigation.
